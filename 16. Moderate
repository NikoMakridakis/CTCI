PROBLEMS
===========================================================================================================

16.1  Number Swapper: Write a function to swap a number in place (that is, without temporary variables).  
 
16.2  Word Frequencies: Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in a
      book. What if we were running this algorithm mUltiple times? 

16.3  Intersection: Given two straight line segments (represented as a start point and an end point)'
      compute the point of intersection, if any. 
    
16.4  Tic Tac Win: Design an algorithm to figure out if someone has won a game of tic-tac-toe. 
  
16.5  Factorial Zeros: Write an algorithm which computes the number of trailing zeros in n factorial. 
 
16.6  Smallest Difference: Given two arrays of integers, compute the pair of values (one value in each
      array) with the smallest (non-negative) difference. Return the difference.
      EXAMPLE
      Input{1, 3, 15, 11, 2), (23, 127, 235, 19, 8)
      Output 3. That is, the pair (11, 8). 
    
16.7  Number Max: Write a method that finds the maximum of two numbers. You should not use if-else
      or any other comparison operator. 
    
16.8  English tnt: Given any integer, print an English phrase that describes the integer (e.g., "One
      Thousand, Two Hundred Thirty Four"). 

   
16.9  Operations: Write methods to implement the multiply, subtract, and divide operations for integers.
      The results of all of these are integers. Use only the add operator
    
16.10 Living People: Given a list of people with their birth and death years, implement a method to
      compute the year with the most number of people alive. You may assume that all people were born
      between 1900 and 2000 (inclusive). If a person was alive during any portion of that year, they should
      be included in that year's count. For example, Person (birth = 1908, death = 1909) is included in the
      counts for both 1908 and 1909. 

16.11 Diving Board: You are building a diving board by placing a bunch of planks of wood end-to-end.
      There are two types of planks, one of length shorter and one of length longer. You must use
      exactly K planks of wood. Write a method to generate all possible lengths for the diving board. 
      
16.12 XML Encoding: Since XML is very verbose, you are given a way of encoding it where each tag gets
      mapped to a pre-defined integer value. The language/grammar is as follows:
      Element     -->   Tag Attributes END Children END
      Attribute   -->   Tag Value
      END         -->   0
      Tag         -->   some predefined mapping to int
      Value       -->   string value 
      For example, the following XML might be converted into the compressed string below (assuming a
      mapping of family -> 1, person -> 2, firstName -> 3, lastName -> 4, state -> 5).
      <family lastName="McDowell" state="CA")
        <person firstName="Gayle">Some Message</person)
      </family)
      Becomes:
      1 4 McDowell 5 CA 0 2 3 Gayle 0 Some Message 0 0
      Write code to print the encoded version of an XML element (passed in Element and Attribute
      objects). 
      
16.13 Bisect Squares: Given two squares on a two-dimensional plane, find a line that would cut these two
      squares in half. Assume that the top and the bottom sides of the square run parallel to the x-axis. 
      
16.14 Best Line: Given a two-dimensional graph with points on it, find a line which passes the most
      number of points. 
      
16.15 Master Mind: The Game of Master Mind is played as follows:
      The computer has four slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red (R), yellow (Y), green (G) or
      blue (B). For example, the computer might have RGGB (Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot
      #4 is blue).
      You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess YRGB.
      When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a "hit" If you guess a color that exists
      but is in the wrong slot, you get a "pseudo-hit:' Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as a
      pseudo-hit.
      For example, if the actual solution is RGBY and you guess GGRR, you have one hit and one pseudohit.
      Write a method that, given a guess and a solution, returns the number of hits and pseudo-hits.
      
16.16 Sub Sort: Given an array of integers, write a method to find indices m and n such that if you sorted
      elements m through n, the entire array would be sorted. Minimize n - m (that is, find the smallest
      such sequence).
      EXAMPLE
      Input: 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19
      Output: (3, 9) 
      
16.17 Contiguous Sequence: You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative). Find the
      contiguous sequence with the largest sum. Return the sum.
      EXAMPLE
      Input 2, -8, 3, -2, 4, -10
      OutputS (i.e., {3, -2, 4}) 
      
16.18 Pattern Matching: You are given two strings, pattern and value. The pattern string consists of
      just the letters a and b, describing a pattern within a string. For example, the string cat catgoc at go
      matches the pattern aabab (where cat is a and go is b). It also matches patterns like a, ab, and b.
      Write a method to determine if value matches pattern. 
      
16.19 Pond Sizes: You have an integer matrix representing a plot of land, where the value at that location
      represents the height above sea level. A value of zero indicates water. A pond is a region of water
      connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The size of the pond is the total number of
      connected water cells. Write a method to compute the sizes of all ponds in the matrix.
      EXAMPLE
      Input:
      0 2 1 0
      0 1 0 1
      1 1 0 1
      0 1 0 1
      Output: 2, 4, 1 (in any order)
      
16.20 T9: On old cell phones, users typed on a numeric keypad and the phone would provide a list of words
      that matched these numbers. Each digit mapped to a set of 0 - 4 letters. Implement an algorithm
      to return a list of matching words, given a sequence of digits. You are provided a list of valid words
      (provided in whatever data structure you'd like). The mapping is shown in the diagram below: 
            1             2             3
                         abc           def
            
            4             5             6
           ghi           jkl           mno
            
            7             8             9
           pqrs          tuv           wxyz
              
                          0
                          
      EXAMPLE
      Input: 8733
      Output: tree, used
      
16.21 Sum Swap: Given two arrays of integers, find a pair of values (one value from each array) that you
      can swap to give the two arrays the same sum.
      EXAMPLE
      Input:{4, l, 2, l, l, 2} and {3, 6, 3, 3}
      Output: {l, 3} 
      
16.22 Langton's Ant: An ant is sitting on an infinite grid of white and black squares. It initially faces right.
      At each step, it does the following:
      (1) At a white square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees right (clockwise), and move forward
      one unit.
      (2) At a black square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees left (counter-clockwise), and move
      forward one unit.
      Write a program to simulate the first K moves that the ant makes and print the final board as a grid.
      Note that you are not provided with the data structure to represent the grid. This is something you
      must design yourself. The only input to your method is K. You should print the final grid and return
      nothing. The method signature might be something like void printKMoves (int K) . 
      
16.23 Rand7 from RandS: Implement a method rand7() given randS(). That is, given a method that
      generates a random number between 0 and 4 (inclusive), write a method that generates a random
      number between 0 and 6 (inclusive). 

16.24 Pairs with Sum: Design an algorithm to find all pairs of integers within an array which sum to a
      specified value. 
      
16.25 LRU Cache: Design and build a "least recently used" cache, which evicts the least recently used item.
      The cache should map from keys to values (allowing you to insert and retrieve a value associated
      with a particular key) and be initialized with a max size. When it is full, it should evict the least
      recently used item. You can assume the keys are integers and the values are strings. 
      
16.26 Calculator: Given an arithmetic equation consisting of positive integers, +, -, * and / (no parentheses),
      compute the result.
      EXAMPLE
      Input: 2*3+5/6*3+15
      Output: 23.5
